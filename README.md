Recreating graduate level papers concerning Youtube Information Panels and Google's National vs Local News 
CS234_project_ZEYNEP.ipynb is the recreation of the paper "Auditing YouTube’s Information Panels: What Do They Cover and How?" 

The recreation heavily relies on the  paper “Measuring misinformation in video search platforms: an audit study on YouTube”, 
so some features are added to this project as well as the publicly available data.
