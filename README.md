Recreating graduate level papers concerning Youtube Information Panels and Google's National vs Local News 


CS234_project_ZEYNEP.ipynb is the recreation of the paper "Auditing YouTube’s Information Panels: What Do They Cover and How?" 
The recreation heavily relies on the  paper “Measuring misinformation in video search platforms: an audit study on YouTube”, 
so some features are added to this project as well as the publicly available data. 

googlenews-articles_FINAL.ipynb is the recreation of the paper "Auditing Local News Presence in Google News" 
The recreation uses  code and data from the “Auditing Google News” paper but 
uses Selenium to collect data from different geographical locations. The Gini index is recreated with new data.
